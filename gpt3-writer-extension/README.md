### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This is my version of the buildspace [build your own AI writing assistant w/ GPT-3](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer) project. 

### **Questions?**
For project questions [buildspace Dashboard](https://buildspace.so/p/build-ai-writing-assistant-gpt3) and link your Discord account so I have set this gpt writer to act as an extension on chrome, accept your key to OpenAI's GPT 3, and give explanations to highlighted text in terms of the python programming language. e.g. if highlighting 'class', right clicking, and the activating this extension, it will send a query to the OpenAI API and return an explanation of python classes.

My current setup can write this response directly into https://www.calmlywriter.com/online/ as paragraphs. If you want to change this for other websites, you can inspect them and make appropriate changes to 'scripts/content.js'.
